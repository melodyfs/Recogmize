# Recogmize
A showcase of deep learning projects I built.

## Inspiration
I am very enthusiastic about deep learning. I explored and learned it in my spare time. All the models were written in python (source code will become public soon!). <br/>

After a month, uut of boredom, I decided to turn all the python code into an iOS app for fun.

## Pre-Trained Models
Models were mainly built with Keras, NumPy, and sklearn. Then they were converted to CoreML models with CoreMl Tools.
- Mnist (NN and CNN)
- Cifar10 (CNN)
- Hiragana (CNN)
- Katakana (CNN)
- Fruits: Inception V3 Model + layers of Neural Nets
